# Digital-Scientific-Calculator-And-Advanced-Project-

A Digital Scientific Calculator is a powerful electronic device or software tool designed to perform advanced mathematical, scientific, and engineering calculations. Unlike basic calculators, it offers functions that go far beyond simple arithmetic, making it essential for students, professionals, and researchers.

ðŸ§ª Core Capabilities

Scientific Functions: Handles trigonometric (sin, cos, tan), logarithmic (log, ln), and exponential operations.

Complex Numbers: Supports calculations involving imaginary and complex numbers.

Statistical Analysis: Performs mean, standard deviation, regression, and probability functions.

Equation Solving: Solves quadratic and polynomial equations, systems of equations, and inequalities.

Programming & Memory: Some models allow users to store and recall values or even create simple programs.

Unit Conversions: Converts between metric and imperial units, or between degrees and radians.
